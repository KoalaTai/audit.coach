The main classes and functions to be implemented will be:

1. `ResumeUpload`: This class will be responsible for handling the file upload and parsing the uploaded resumes.

2. `handle_upload(file)`: This function will take in a file as an argument and handle the uploading process. It will be a method within the `ResumeUpload` class.

3. `parse_resume(file)`: This function will take in a file as an argument and parse the uploaded resumes to extract relevant information. It will be a method within the `ResumeUpload` class.

Now, let's start with the code implementation. We will be using Python and the Flask framework for this task.
