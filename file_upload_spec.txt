# Specification

## Overview

The new feature will be responsible for securely uploading, validating, encrypting, storing, decrypting, and analyzing the interviewee's resume and company's QMS documents. The feature will support different types of documents such as PDF, Word, and text files. 

## Core Classes and Functions

1. `DocumentUploader`: This class will be responsible for handling the upload of the documents. It will have methods such as `uploadDocument(file)` which will take a file as input and upload it to the server.

2. `DocumentValidator`: This class will validate the uploaded documents. It will have methods like `validateDocument(file)` which will validate the document format and content.

3. `DocumentEncryptor`: This class will handle the encryption of the documents. It will have methods such as `encryptDocument(file)` which will take a document as input and encrypt it for secure storage.

4. `DocumentDecryptor`: This class will handle the decryption of the documents. It will have methods such as `decryptDocument(file)` which will take an encrypted document as input and decrypt it for access.

5. `DocumentAnalyzer`: This class will be responsible for extracting and analyzing the content of the documents. It will have methods such as `analyzeDocument(file)` which will extract and analyze the content of the document.

## Non-standard Dependencies

1. `multer`: A middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is primarily used for uploading files.

2. `pdf-parse`: A library for parsing PDF documents and extracting content.

3. `mammoth.js`: A library for converting .docx documents (Word) to HTML or plain text.

4. `crypto-js`: A library for cryptographic operations like encryption and decryption.

5. `file-type`: A library for validating the file type of uploaded documents.

## Detailed Description

The new feature will be integrated into the existing Audit Coach application. The user will be able to select a document (resume or QMS document) from their local system and upload it to the application. The application will validate the document to ensure it is of a supported type (PDF, Word, or text file) and is not corrupted. 

Once validated, the document will be encrypted using a secure encryption algorithm before it is stored on the server. The encryption will ensure that even if the server is compromised, the content of the documents will remain secure. 

When the user needs to access the document, the application will decrypt the document and present it to the user. 

If necessary, the application will also be able to extract the content of the document and analyze it. This could be useful for automatically extracting information from the resume or QMS document and using it in the application. 

The feature will be implemented in a modular way, with separate classes for each of the main functionalities (uploading, validating, encrypting, decrypting, and analyzing). This will make the code easier to maintain and extend in the future. 

The code will be pushed to the `audit.coach` repository on Github.
